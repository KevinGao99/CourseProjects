NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film.  \\nRight IJ central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  Left IJ central line\\nis not well visualized, but probably overlies the distal SVC.  Surgical clips\\nare again noted in the left paratracheal region.  No pneumothorax are again\\nnoted.\\n\\nAgain seen are diffuse alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, with air\\nbronchograms, and increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower\\nlobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly more\\nobscured on the current study.  There is leftward positioning of the\\ncardiomediastinal silhouette.  While this apparent may be due to slight \\npatient rotation and mild right convex curvature, the possibility of some\\nvolume loss left-sided volume loss cannot be excluded.  This appearance is\\nsimilar to the prior study.  No right pleural effusion is identified.

No pneumothorax is detected.\\n\\nET tube tip lies approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is\\npresent, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Allowing for differences\\nin positioning, the left IJ central line and cardiomediastinal silhouette are\\nprobably unchanged.  Diffuse alveolar opacities, with retrocardiac opacity,\\nare similar to the prior film.  Left paratracheal surgical clips again noted.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nInterval placement a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with tip over proximal right\\npulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax detected.

Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.\\n\\nAgain seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs. \\nAllowing for technical differences, there appears to been slight improvement\\nin the upper zone and along the upper periphery of both right and left lungs.\\n\\nOtherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is detected. \\nSmall effusions cannot be excluded.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nSpine Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies right pulmonary artery, somewhat distal.\\nClinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.\\n\\nPersistent diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, but with suggestion of\\nslight interval improvement.\\n\\nNote 9: EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 2 EXAMS\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ year old man with swan ganz catheter in place, now pulled back\\n1 cm  // please assess for placement\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 23:22\\n\\nFINDINGS: \\n\\nSlightly rotated positioning.\\n\\nCompared with the prior study, the Swan-___ catheter tip is been retracted is\\nnow overlies the proximal right pulmonary artery.  It is near but does not\\ncross the vertical/ ___ portion of the ___ catheter.\\n\\nThe ET tube is obscured due to overlying structures, but is probably not\\nsignificantly changed in position.  Right IJ central line tip overlies distal\\nSVC/RA junction, unchanged.  NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm.\\n\\nAgain seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse\\nand/or consolidation.  Are also of a Z interstitial on the alveolar opacities\\nin the right lung and vascular plethora rod with hazy opacity in the left\\nupper zone, similar to the prior film.  Small bilateral effusions would be\\ndifficult to exclude.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nInterval repositioning of ___-___ catheter tip.  The tip likely overlies the\\nproximal right pulmonary artery, detailed above.  If clinically indicated, an\\nAP chest x-ray with less pronounced the patient rotation could help to compare\\npositioning.\\n\\nOtherwise, allowing for differences in technique and positioning, I doubt\\nsignificant interval change.\\n\\nNote 10: EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // daily eval\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nAs compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube now\\nterminates 1.4 cm above the carinal with the neck apparently in a flexed\\nposition.

The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile\\nfashion.\\nUnder continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein\\nwas compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle.  Images of\\nultrasound access were stored on PACS. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed\\ninto the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. A small incision was made\\nat the needle entry site. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.\\nThe Nitinol wire was removed and a long Amplatz wire was advanced distally\\ninto the IVC.\\nThe micropuncture sheath was then removed and a 10 ___ sheath was advanced\\nover the wire into the inferior vena cava.  Using a Glidewire and a modified\\nC2 catheter, access was obtained in the right hepatic vein. Appropriate\\nposition was confirmed with contrast injection and fluoroscopy in AP and\\nlateral views.  Then an occlusion balloon was advanced over the wire into the\\ndistal right hepatic vein.

Following stent deployment, the stent was dilated using a 10 mm\\nballoon.\\nThe straight flush catheter was advanced over the wire and the wire was\\nremoved. Repeat hepatic vein, right atrial and portal vein pressure\\nmeasurements were performed.  The straight flush catheter was exchanged for a\\nSos catheter fluid with a guidewire which was used to select a large coronary\\nvarix arising from the portal vein.  Embolization of this varix was performed\\nwith five ___ coils as well as 10 cc of ethanol.  The soft catheter was\\nexchanged for a straight flush catheter and post embolization splenic and\\nportal venogram for performed.\\nThe sheath was then removed from the right internal jugular vein site and\\npressure held for 10 minutes to achieve hemostasis.

NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film.  \\nRight IJ central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  Left IJ central line\\nis not well visualized, but probably overlies the distal SVC.  Surgical clips\\nare again noted in the left paratracheal region.  No pneumothorax are again\\nnoted.\\n\\nAgain seen are diffuse alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, with air\\nbronchograms, and increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower\\nlobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The left hemidiaphragm is slightly more\\nobscured on the current study.  There is leftward positioning of the\\ncardiomediastinal silhouette.  While this apparent may be due to slight \\npatient rotation and mild right convex curvature, the possibility of some\\nvolume loss left-sided volume loss cannot be excluded.  This appearance is\\nsimilar to the prior study.  No right pleural effusion is identified.

No pneumothorax is detected.\\n\\nET tube tip lies approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is\\npresent, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Allowing for differences\\nin positioning, the left IJ central line and cardiomediastinal silhouette are\\nprobably unchanged.  Diffuse alveolar opacities, with retrocardiac opacity,\\nare similar to the prior film.  Left paratracheal surgical clips again noted.\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nInterval placement a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with tip over proximal right\\npulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax detected.

Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.\\n\\nAgain seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs. \\nAllowing for technical differences, there appears to been slight improvement\\nin the upper zone and along the upper periphery of both right and left lungs.\\n\\nOtherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  No pneumothorax is detected. \\nSmall effusions cannot be excluded.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nSpine Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies right pulmonary artery, somewhat distal.\\nClinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested.\\n\\nPersistent diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, but with suggestion of\\nslight interval improvement.\\n\\nNote 9: EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 2 EXAMS\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ year old man with swan ganz catheter in place, now pulled back\\n1 cm  // please assess for placement\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 23:22\\n\\nFINDINGS: \\n\\nSlightly rotated positioning.\\n\\nCompared with the prior study, the Swan-___ catheter tip is been retracted is\\nnow overlies the proximal right pulmonary artery.  It is near but does not\\ncross the vertical/ ___ portion of the ___ catheter.\\n\\nThe ET tube is obscured due to overlying structures, but is probably not\\nsignificantly changed in position.  Right IJ central line tip overlies distal\\nSVC/RA junction, unchanged.  NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm.\\n\\nAgain seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse\\nand/or consolidation.  Are also of a Z interstitial on the alveolar opacities\\nin the right lung and vascular plethora rod with hazy opacity in the left\\nupper zone, similar to the prior film.  Small bilateral effusions would be\\ndifficult to exclude.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nInterval repositioning of ___-___ catheter tip.  The tip likely overlies the\\nproximal right pulmonary artery, detailed above.  If clinically indicated, an\\nAP chest x-ray with less pronounced the patient rotation could help to compare\\npositioning.\\n\\nOtherwise, allowing for differences in technique and positioning, I doubt\\nsignificant interval change.\\n\\nNote 10: EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // daily eval\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\nAs compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube now\\nterminates 1.4 cm above the carinal with the neck apparently in a flexed\\nposition.

The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile\\nfashion.\\nUnder continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein\\nwas compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle.  Images of\\nultrasound access were stored on PACS. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed\\ninto the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. A small incision was made\\nat the needle entry site. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.\\nThe Nitinol wire was removed and a long Amplatz wire was advanced distally\\ninto the IVC.\\nThe micropuncture sheath was then removed and a 10 ___ sheath was advanced\\nover the wire into the inferior vena cava.  Using a Glidewire and a modified\\nC2 catheter, access was obtained in the right hepatic vein. Appropriate\\nposition was confirmed with contrast injection and fluoroscopy in AP and\\nlateral views.  Then an occlusion balloon was advanced over the wire into the\\ndistal right hepatic vein.

Following stent deployment, the stent was dilated using a 10 mm\\nballoon.\\nThe straight flush catheter was advanced over the wire and the wire was\\nremoved. Repeat hepatic vein, right atrial and portal vein pressure\\nmeasurements were performed.  The straight flush catheter was exchanged for a\\nSos catheter fluid with a guidewire which was used to select a large coronary\\nvarix arising from the portal vein.  Embolization of this varix was performed\\nwith five ___ coils as well as 10 cc of ethanol.  The soft catheter was\\nexchanged for a straight flush catheter and post embolization splenic and\\nportal venogram for performed.\\nThe sheath was then removed from the right internal jugular vein site and\\npressure held for 10 minutes to achieve hemostasis.

language model **refers to the process of further training the pre-trained model on a specific task or domain using a smaller dataset.** The initial pre-training phase involves training a language model on a massive corpus of text data to learn general language patterns and representations. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, customizes the model to a specific task or domain by exposing it to task-specific data. By fine-tuning a large language model on a specific task, you leverage the pre-trained knowledge of the model while tailoring it to the nuances and requirements of your target task. This typically allows the model to perform better and achieve higher accuracy on the specific task compared to using the pretrained model by itself for your specific task.\n","\n","#### ▶ **What is instruction following/tuning? Why should I do it?**\n","\n","Pre-trained language models are often great at giving general answers, but they struggle when asked to follow specific instructions, especially for tasks in certain domains. To make a pre-trained model do better at these specific tasks, we can train it on examples of those tasks. This is called instruction fine-tuning. We use a dataset with pairs of `{instructions, outputs}` in the domain, and this helps the model learn to give the right response when given those types of instructions. This training process typically changes the underlying model weights, but there are also other ways to train it without doing this. When done correctly, this process teaches the model to understand and follow instructions it couldn't handle well before.\n","\n","#### ▶ **What will this teach the model?**\n","\n","Here's an example of prompting the base model and an example prompting the fine-tuned model. The model was given all of the text until `Response:`, and it was supposed to continue generating an appropriate response.\n","\n","**Using the base model (no fine-tuning):** 👎\n","```\n","Instruction: \"Based on the provided context, return true if the pation has ARDS, otherwise return false.\"\n","Input: #MEDICAL NOTES FOR THE PATIENT#\n","Output:Instruction: \"Based on the provided context, return true if the pation has ARDS, otherwise return false.\"\n","Input: #MEDICAL NOTES FOR THE PATIENT#\n","```\n","\n","**After instruction-fine-tuning:** 👍\n","```\n","Instruction: \"Based on the provided context, return true if the pation has ARDS, otherwise return false.\"\n","Input: #MEDICAL NOTES FOR THE PATIENT#\n","Output:True\n","```\n","\n","The base model does not know how to follow-instructions and answer the question for our task, so just repeats the inputs we passed in until the token limit is hit. Our fine-tuned model should be able to respond back correctly (these are actual outputs from a model we fine-tuned).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oU8iKtqwCc1b"},"source":["There are three different fine-tuning approaches in Ludwig:\n","\n","1. **Full Fine-Tuning**:\n","\n","- Involves training the entire pre-trained model on new data from scratch.\n","- All model layers and parameters are updated during fine-tuning.\n","- Can lead to high accuracy but requires a significant amount of computational resources and time.\n","- Runs the risk of catastrophic forgetting: occasionally, since we are updating all of the weights in the model, this process can lead to the algorithm inadvertently losing knowledge of its past tasks, i.e., the knowledge it gained during pretraining. The outcome may vary, with the algorithm experiencing heightened error margins in some cases, while in others, it might completely erase the memory of a specific task leading to terrible performance.\n","- Best suited when the target task is significantly different from the original pre-training task.\n","\n","2. **Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), e.g. LoRA**:\n","\n","- Focuses on updating only a subset of the model's parameters.\n","- Often involves freezing certain layers or parts of the model to avoid catastrophic forgetting, or inserting additional layers that are trainable while keeping the original model's weights frozen.\n","- Can result in faster fine-tuning with fewer computational resources, but might sacrifice some accuracy compared to full fine-tuning.\n","- Includes methods like LoRA, AdaLoRA and Adaption Prompt (LLaMA Adapter)\n","- Suitable when the new task shares similarities with the original pre-training task.\n","\n","3. **Quantization-Based Fine-Tuning (QLoRA)**:\n","\n","- Involves reducing the precision of model parameters (e.g., converting 32-bit floating-point values to 8-bit or 4-bit integers). This reduces the amount of CPU and GPU memory required by either 4x if using 8-bit integers, or 8x if using 4-bit integers.\n","- Typically, since we're changing the weights to 8 or 4 bit integers, we will lose some precision/performance.\n","- This can lead to reduced memory usage and faster inference on hardware with reduced precision support.\n","- Particularly useful when deploying models on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones or edge devices.\n","\n","\n","**We're going to fine-tune using method 3 since we only have access to a single T4 GPU with 16GiB of GPU VRAM on Colab.** If you have more compute available, give LoRA based fine-tuning or full fine-tuning a try! Typically this requires 4 GPUs with 24GiB of GPU VRAM on a single node multi-GPU cluster and fine-tuning Deepspeeed.\n","\n","\n","To do this, the new parameters we're introducing are:\n","\n","- `adapter`: The PEFT method we want to use\n","- `quantization`: Load the weights in int4 or int8 to reduce memory overhead.\n","- `trainer`: We enable the `finetune` trainer and can configure a variety of training parameters such as epochs and learning rate."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1Z14-5zQ2aE8"},"source":["**Important Note: Set an alarm clock⏰ to upload/download your model in time, otherwise colab will kill the runtime and you will lose all training progress.**\n","\n","**Important Notes2: If you get a `CUDA OUT OF MEMORY` error, you need to restart the runtime because the garbage memory can't be properly collected.**\n","\n","**Important Notes3: If it shows no GPU runtime available, it means you have reached to limit for free accounts and you need to wait for 24 hours to get access to new GPU nodes.**\n","\n","The cell below provides an example to finetune LLAMA2-7B model.
